This is a multi-touch FM synth I made in 2019. The fluid sim was forked from [PavelDoGreat's WebGL Fluid Simulation](https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/).

You can play with it yourself at this [Netlify site](https://5dd714ce9982689a05bd96dd--vigilant-lumiere-040d89.netlify.app/)
